Let's see how a codepen embed looks.

<p data-height="544" data-theme-id="7588" data-slug-hash="vGruJ" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/danlucas/pen/vGruJ/'>Digital Clock</a> by danlucas (<a href='http://codepen.io/danlucas'>@danlucas</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Can't change the colors all that much without paying for it so I can't really make it look like the rest of the site, but that's okay.
