Hello, a few things need some work around here:

* stop letting github generate the site, generate the site yourself then push the site to the repository
* use another markup styling
* update the styling (watch out for potential clashes between the front page and the posts themselves).
* test codepen embeds
* attach a pattern library
* create a changelog
* set up a trello board for my todos here (you don't really think I'm going to place all my todos here, do you?)
    * This is merely a test to write a new post
    * I am going to do the things I said though and delete this posts once I actually have a good starting post
